<h2> IDEA </h2>

A friend of mine, resident doctor, complained to me about continuous need to fill a *clinical observation form*, which
also has **repetitive fields** in different pages (e.g.: "Numele" (Name) is requested on page 1, but also on page 9).

<h2> STEPS </h2>
    The clinical observation form is available at: [link_clinical_form](http://www.spitalbt-sfgheorghe.ro/Legislatie/Foaia-de-observatie/formulare_medicale_foaie_observatie_clinica_generala.pdf)

<h2> TODO </h2>
